<p>Sometimes i hear pretty bad distortions, lags and cracks while listening to spotify or playing games.
The following settings helped me in my case.</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo nano /etc/pulse/daemon.conf

# search for ; default-fragment-size-msec
# remove the ; and set its value to something below 50
# for its working with 5
# save, quit and restart pulseaudio

pulseaudio -k;pulseaudio --start
</code></pre></div>
