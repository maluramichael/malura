Some of you may know that a couple of game developers get together every month to code games, drink, talk and have a good time.

The 27.10.2018 was one of these days. Again we met at the [Toolbox Bodensee](https://toolbox-bodensee.de/) a big hackspace here in south Germany.

We started at 10am with some Club Mate and talked a lot about our current projects. At 1pm I held a presentation about [Reverse engineering](https://files.malura.de/presentations/silver-reverse-engineering-presentation/)

This time I didn't code so much. I just implemented a simple behavior stack for a game I'm working on.

I talked a lot to the developer of [Drag](https://www.indiedb.com/games/drag)

At 12am I packed my stuff and drove home.
